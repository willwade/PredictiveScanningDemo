Did you catch the match last night? Absolute nail-biter, wasn’t it?
I’ve just popped the kettle on, fancy a cuppa?
I can’t believe how much it’s rained this week; proper miserable, isn’t it?
Oh, go on then, just one biscuit, but don’t let me eat the whole pack!
You’re not gonna believe who I bumped into at the shops today!
What’s for tea tonight? I’m absolutely starving!
Blimey, you look like you’ve been through the wars—what happened?
Oh, it’s just typical, isn’t it? The one day I leave the brolly at home!
It’s not half chilly out there; best wrap up warm if you’re heading out.
I’ve been meaning to call you all week, but you know how it is—life gets in the way.
That was a cracking idea you had the other day, really clever.
You’re having a laugh, aren’t you? I’d never have guessed that in a million years.
Couldn’t believe me luck when I found a tenner just lying on the pavement!
Do you remember that summer we spent in Cornwall? Those were the days, weren’t they?
What do you reckon to this lot then? Bit over the top if you ask me.
I don’t mean to be cheeky, but could you give us a hand with this?
He’s been faffing about for hours, hasn’t he? Typical!
I’m so chuffed for you, honestly, you really deserve it.
You’ve got to be pulling my leg—that can’t be true!
Right, I’ll leave you to it then, but let’s catch up soon, yeah?
I was just saying to Mum, it’s like stepping back in time coming here.
If I had a quid for every time someone said that, I’d be rich!
Honestly, you wouldn’t believe the state of the place when I got there.
What time do you reckon you’ll be popping round? Just so I can get sorted.
I know I’m biased, but isn’t she the cutest little thing you’ve ever seen?
I could murder a fry-up right about now—got any sausages in?
I was proper gutted when they said they’d run out of chips at the chippy.
Would you Adam and Eve it? They’ve gone and done it again!
Fancy a cheeky pint after work? My shout this time.
It’s not exactly rocket science, is it? Just give it a go!
That new café round the corner is supposed to be really good—shall we try it?
Oh, don’t get me started on the trains—late again, as per usual!
Well, that’s just the cherry on top, isn’t it? Absolutely typical!
I was just saying to Jan the other day, you don’t see many of those about anymore.
You’re looking sharp today—what’s the occasion?
I wouldn’t touch that with a bargepole, to be honest with you.
You alright, love? You’ve been quiet—everything okay?
I was gobsmacked when I heard; couldn’t believe my ears!
I’ll tell you what, though, it’s not a patch on what it used to be.
Let’s have a butcher’s at that, then—see what we’re working with.
I know I shouldn’t, but go on then—just one more slice won’t hurt.
You’re looking well—have you been on holiday or something?
I wouldn’t mind a bit of that myself, if I’m being honest.
You’ve got to laugh, haven’t you? Otherwise you’d cry.
Well, that’s a turn-up for the books! Never saw that coming.
I’ve had a right mare of a day—everything that could go wrong did.
You’ve been up to much lately, or just the usual?
You’ll never guess who I ran into—only old Mrs. Jenkins from number 34!
I’ve got to admit, that’s not half bad—fair play to them.
Let me know if you’re popping by later—I’ll stick the kettle on.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s raining cats and dogs tomorrow.
You’re not wrong there—spot on, actually.
Well, there’s a first time for everything, isn’t there?
I’m feeling a bit peckish—fancy grabbing a bite?
That’s bang out of order, mate—no need for that.
If you need me, I’ll be in the garden with a cuppa and a book.
I’ve been rushed off my feet all day—haven’t had a minute to myself!
Shall we make a move then, or are you staying a bit longer?
I’ve got half a mind to give them a piece of my mind.
You’ve got to hand it to them—they’ve done a cracking job.
That’s a bit rich, coming from you of all people!
I was over the moon when I found out—such a relief.
It’s been one of those weeks, hasn’t it? Non-stop from start to finish.
I could do with a lie-in tomorrow—don’t wake me before nine.
I’ll swing by the shops on the way home—need anything?
Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for them, but it’s a bit much, isn’t it?
Oh, come off it, you’re pulling my leg!
I was in stitches—it was absolutely hilarious.
I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes.
You’re always welcome here, you know that.
It’s got to be said, that was a job well done.
What do you fancy for pudding? I’ve got ice cream or sticky toffee.
I’ll see myself out—thanks for having me.
