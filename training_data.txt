Hi, how are you?
Can you help me?
What time is it?
I don't understand.
Yes, please.
No, thank you.
I'm feeling tired.
That's great news!
Where are you going?
I need a drink.
Can we talk later?
This is my favorite.

That's not what I meant.
What do you think?
Can I join you?
It's really nice outside.
I'm not sure about that.
Why did you say that?
I'm hungry.
Please wait a moment.
I love this song.
That's too loud.
Can you turn it down?
What should we do now?
I'm ready to go.
I don't like this.
Is there another option?
I agree with you.
That makes sense.
How does it work?
I have a question.
Do you understand me?
