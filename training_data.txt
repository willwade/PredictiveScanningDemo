Hi, how are you?
Can you help me?
What time is it?
I don't understand.
Yes, please.
No, thank you.
Hello
Goodbye 
Will 
I'm feeling tired.
That's great news!
Where are you going?
I need a drink.
Can we talk later?
This is my favorite.
I'm so happy!
That's not what I meant.
What do you think?
Can I join you?
It's really nice outside.
I'm not sure about that.
Why did you say that?
I'm hungry.
Please wait a moment.
I love this song.
That's too loud.
Can you turn it down?
What should we do now?
I'm ready to go.
I don't like this.
Is there another option?
I agree with you.
That makes sense.
How does it work?
I have a question.
Do you understand me?
I think so.
What are you doing?
I didn't mean to.
It wasn't my fault.
That's okay.
No worries.
I'm sorry.
It's not a problem.
I'm so excited!
This is important.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
How can I help?
Can you show me?
I'm not sure.
That's interesting.
Tell me more.
What's next?
That was fun.
Do you want to try?
I really enjoyed that.
I'm not feeling well.
Can we stop here?
I need some help.
Let's do it again.
I'm feeling nervous.
That's a great idea!
What do you want?
Let's think about it.
I'm so proud of you.
You can do it!
Don't give up.
You're amazing.
I'm listening.
Can you repeat that?
I didn't catch that.
What do you need?
Let's work together.
We can fix this.
It's a big problem.
I don't think so.
You're doing great!
That's not right.
What do you like?
Do you need help?
I'm so sorry.
That's really funny.
Let's try something new.
It's getting late.
I need a break.
Can you explain?
What's the plan?
I love spending time with you.
You're my best friend.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
That's incredible.
I need more information.
That's a good question.
I feel the same way.
You're very kind.
Let's be friends.
That's not what I wanted.
What's the weather like?
I can't wait!
Let's talk soon.
It's a beautiful day.
This is wonderful.
How are you feeling?
What happened?
It's not fair.
Can I help you?
You're doing amazing.
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.
Can we try again?
What do you prefer?
I'm so grateful.
I appreciate it.
You're so talented.
This is fantastic!
I don't think I can.
You're right.
Let's get started.
I'm ready now.
What's your name?
Can you believe it?
You're my favorite.
I trust you.
You're so funny.
This is really hard.
I can't believe it.
Let's do it together.
You're so brave.
Can you help me understand?
You're so smart.
What's your opinion?
This is so exciting!
What should I say?
I feel so lucky.
I'm so tired.
What are you thinking?
Do you want to go?
Let's go there.
You're the best.
I'm really nervous.
It's going to be okay.
What's your favorite?
I'm not sure about this.
This is amazing!
What do you think about this?
I'm not feeling well today.
Let's stay here.
Can we change the topic?
I'm not interested.
It's very important to me.
This means a lot to me.
I'm so sorry for that.
That's really cool.
Can we try something else?
You're doing so well.
I can't explain it.
This is what I wanted.
You're so helpful.
What should we do?
I'm not ready yet.
Can we talk about it?
That's very thoughtful.
Can you hear me?
I'm really enjoying this.
You're very special to me.
I'm having so much fun.
Can we start over?
Let's focus on this.
You're such a good friend.
I feel really good about this.
You're very patient.
I really need this.
Let's keep going.
You're so creative.
That's very kind of you.
I don't want to talk about it.
It's a bit confusing.
I need some time to think.
That's not what I expected.
I believe in you.
You're very thoughtful.
What can I do for you?
I really like this.
This is very helpful.
You're so supportive.
Can we finish this later?
You're very understanding.
It's very challenging.
Can we go now?
I need to rest.
You're very inspiring.
I can't wait to see you.
It's so relaxing.
What do you think about it?
You're very polite.
Can you do this for me?
It's really nice of you.
You're so caring.
Let's think of a solution.
You're such a good listener.
I really appreciate this.
It's been a long day.
Let's celebrate!
It's so quiet here.
You're so funny!
I'm having a great time.
I don't understand this.
You're very reliable.
What can I say?
It's hard to decide.
You're very generous.
Let's figure it out together.
You're very humble.
It's not working.
Can we find another way?
You're so dedicated.
I really like talking to you.
You're such a great person.
I don't want to leave yet.
You're very honest.
Let's give it another try.
I'm learning so much.
You're very talented.
It's so peaceful here.
What do you want to do?
You're very dependable.
This is so much fun!
I feel very lucky.
You're very optimistic.
Can we make it better?
You're such a positive person.
Did you catch the match last night? Absolute nail-biter, wasn’t it?
I’ve just popped the kettle on, fancy a cuppa?
I can’t believe how much it’s rained this week; proper miserable, isn’t it?
Oh, go on then, just one biscuit, but don’t let me eat the whole pack!
You’re not gonna believe who I bumped into at the shops today!
What’s for tea tonight? I’m absolutely starving!
Blimey, you look like you’ve been through the wars—what happened?
Oh, it’s just typical, isn’t it? The one day I leave the brolly at home!
It’s not half chilly out there; best wrap up warm if you’re heading out.
I’ve been meaning to call you all week, but you know how it is—life gets in the way.
That was a cracking idea you had the other day, really clever.
You’re having a laugh, aren’t you? I’d never have guessed that in a million years.
Couldn’t believe me luck when I found a tenner just lying on the pavement!
Do you remember that summer we spent in Cornwall? Those were the days, weren’t they?
What do you reckon to this lot then? Bit over the top if you ask me.
I don’t mean to be cheeky, but could you give us a hand with this?
He’s been faffing about for hours, hasn’t he? Typical!
I’m so chuffed for you, honestly, you really deserve it.
You’ve got to be pulling my leg—that can’t be true!
Right, I’ll leave you to it then, but let’s catch up soon, yeah?
I was just saying to Mum, it’s like stepping back in time coming here.
If I had a quid for every time someone said that, I’d be rich!
Honestly, you wouldn’t believe the state of the place when I got there.
What time do you reckon you’ll be popping round? Just so I can get sorted.
I know I’m biased, but isn’t she the cutest little thing you’ve ever seen?
I could murder a fry-up right about now—got any sausages in?
I was proper gutted when they said they’d run out of chips at the chippy.
Would you Adam and Eve it? They’ve gone and done it again!
Fancy a cheeky pint after work? My shout this time.
It’s not exactly rocket science, is it? Just give it a go!
That new café round the corner is supposed to be really good—shall we try it?
Oh, don’t get me started on the trains—late again, as per usual!
Well, that’s just the cherry on top, isn’t it? Absolutely typical!
I was just saying to Jan the other day, you don’t see many of those about anymore.
You’re looking sharp today—what’s the occasion?
I wouldn’t touch that with a bargepole, to be honest with you.
You alright, love? You’ve been quiet—everything okay?
I was gobsmacked when I heard; couldn’t believe my ears!
I’ll tell you what, though, it’s not a patch on what it used to be.
Let’s have a butcher’s at that, then—see what we’re working with.
I know I shouldn’t, but go on then—just one more slice won’t hurt.
You’re looking well—have you been on holiday or something?
I wouldn’t mind a bit of that myself, if I’m being honest.
You’ve got to laugh, haven’t you? Otherwise you’d cry.
Well, that’s a turn-up for the books! Never saw that coming.
I’ve had a right mare of a day—everything that could go wrong did.
You’ve been up to much lately, or just the usual?
You’ll never guess who I ran into—only old Mrs. Jenkins from number 34!
I’ve got to admit, that’s not half bad—fair play to them.
Let me know if you’re popping by later—I’ll stick the kettle on.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s raining cats and dogs tomorrow.
You’re not wrong there—spot on, actually.
Well, there’s a first time for everything, isn’t there?
I’m feeling a bit peckish—fancy grabbing a bite?
That’s bang out of order, mate—no need for that.
If you need me, I’ll be in the garden with a cuppa and a book.
I’ve been rushed off my feet all day—haven’t had a minute to myself!
Shall we make a move then, or are you staying a bit longer?
I’ve got half a mind to give them a piece of my mind.
You’ve got to hand it to them—they’ve done a cracking job.
That’s a bit rich, coming from you of all people!
I was over the moon when I found out—such a relief.
It’s been one of those weeks, hasn’t it? Non-stop from start to finish.
I could do with a lie-in tomorrow—don’t wake me before nine.
I’ll swing by the shops on the way home—need anything?
Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for them, but it’s a bit much, isn’t it?
Oh, come off it, you’re pulling my leg!
I was in stitches—it was absolutely hilarious.
I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes.
You’re always welcome here, you know that.
It’s got to be said, that was a job well done.
What do you fancy for pudding? I’ve got ice cream or sticky toffee.
I’ll see myself out—thanks for having me.
